<h1 align="center">Chat System</h1>
<h3 align="left">My first project is a chat system that was created in order to learn about sockets, nodejs, and mongodb. The frontend is not very good because the focus is on learning in and out of the backend. Some of the chat features include sending and receiving friend requests, realtime chat and realtime online status, the ability to search other users, sign up and login, storing and retrieving data from the server, and learning much more about how MVC patternÂ works.</h3>
